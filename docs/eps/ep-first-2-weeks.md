Your first week at Commit will fly by, believe us! The main emphasis in your first week is matching you with Startup Partners (SPs), helping you with any interview nerves, and getting you working on your [Hackathon Onboarding Project (HOP)](/eps/ep-hop).

![EP First 2 Weeks](./epfirst2weeks-image.png)

To make sure nothing gets overlooked we have members of our Engineer Success Team there to support you. They will set up a private "EPX-[EP NAME]" channel on Slack so you will be able to ask any questions from Day 1. 

To go along with their support, we have created an onboarding checklist for you with daily prompts. 


## Day 1 (Part 1) - Admin Stuff

We are so excited you are here! These checklist items will be your main tasks for the next 7 days as you get acquainted with all things Commit.

Our primary point of contact is Slack so the Engineer Success team will be messaging you there in a specific channel made just for you (your EPX channel)!

If you have any questions at all during your onboarding, you can direct them there.

**Expectations**:

During your first week at Commit, your focus is on your [HOP Demo](https://docs.commit.dev/eps/ep-hop) and interviewing with Startup Partners (we call them SPs) to start your 3 month pilot. 
You'll present your HOP Demo next Thursday (Day 7 of your Onboarding) to other Engineering Partners (EPs), graduates (GPs) and interested community members! 
We've got a few of the most recent ones [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQRTWrxEpL0SpjyzuIcvePs1LKyTP7pI3) for you to get an idea of what to expect when presenting your demo, and hopefully get you excited!

After your HOP demo, it's expected you'll continue making iterations and project updates to your original HOP.
Want to start a new one instead, or collaborate with another developer on a project? You can absolutely do that too!
The goal is for you to continue to build your skills and contribute to our community.

 This is an extra layer of context put on top of matches, not an input that will impact if you actually do get matched with a startup!

-   Test your setup beforehand - do you need to reinstall Zoom? What will you need to share? Will others be able to hear you clearly with your audio setup?
    
-   We've got a few of the most recent demos [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQRTWrxEpL0SpjyzuIcvePs1LKyTP7pI3) for you to get an idea of what to expect!
