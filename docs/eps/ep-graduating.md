Commit calls the process of you moving to a Startup Partner (SP) full-time “graduating”. It’s part of the process and we are excited when people get to do it!

## Steps to Graduation
 
1. The Engineer Success team will reach out to both you and the SP 1 month before your 3-month pilot end date to determine if you both would like to move forward with graduating.

- If you'd both like to move forward, the Startup Partner will produce an offer for you to review.
- If one or both of you chooses not to move forward, you may be given the option to [return to matchmaking](https://docs.commit.dev/eps/ep-pilot#returning-to-commit-after-a-pilot) after your pilot ends. 

2. Usually the Startup Partner has their own employment agreement that they put together for you to join them. Commit is here to provide support in understanding the offer. 

:::note
We often suggest you inquire about extended health benefits, and request any applicable waiting period be waived as you've already been working with the Startup Partner for 3 months! The same suggestion applies to any probation period.

3. Once you're happy with the offer, sign that paperwork!

If you have any questions about graduating with a SP, reach out to the Engineer Success team on your dedicated Slack channel and they will be able to help you. 

## Operational Offboarding at Commit

If you graduate, our Operations team will be in touch shortly before your last day with Commit to confirm offboarding details with you. 
Generally, here is what to expect during the offboarding process:

**Payroll**
-   You will be paid out any unused vacation on your final payout on the 15th or last day of the month, depending on your official start date with your Startup Partner.

**Your Humi account**

-   Please note that your access to your Humi account will be blocked on your end date. Please download any payslips and documents you may want access to before you last day.

**Benefits**
-   Your group benefits with Commit will terminate at midnight of the last day of your pilot.
-   You will still be able to submit reimbursement claims, etc. for expenses incurred before the termination of your benefits through the Manulife portal.
-   After that date, claims will have to be mailed in as you will no longer have access to the online portal.
-   If you have any questions about the cut-off for submitting claims, let us know in your EPX Slack channel.

 **Your Commit Laptop**

-   If you were sent a laptop from Commit, you will need to return it. Our Operations team will be in touch closer to your graduation date to arrange a return. 

**Your Commit.dev Email**

-   If you have a commit.dev email, it will be deactivated after your last day. If you have any emails you'd like to save, please arrange accordingly. 
-   The Engineer Success team will use your personal email on file for future communications.
-   Your Slack Login has also been changed to your personal email.

**Sphere Coaching**

-   If you are a part of the [Sphere Coaching program](https://docs.commit.dev/epresources/ep-coaching-guide), you will be able to continue using the credits as a member of the Commit Community during your placement (for as long as the program is offered).

## I graduated! What's next?

You will still be a part of the Commit community, have access to our Slack groups, our past and upcoming events, and invited to attend our bi-weekly HOP Demos and monthly All Hands (and we hope you do!).

We want to support you as a member of the Commit community even when you have graduated, including helping you continue growing your career and skills. So we encourage you to stay involved, keep asking (or answering) questions, and getting advice from others in the community. We truly believe that collaboration is the key to success and this is a very open and inclusive community of senior software engineers!
